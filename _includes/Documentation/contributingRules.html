	 				• Each new module must have an example that builds against your UPM library.<br/>
					• Each commit must have a sign-off line by everyone who authored or reviewed them.
					• Commits must be named <file/module>: A good description. <br/>
					• You must license your module under a FOSS license. The recommended license is MIT but any permissive license is fine. Remember that people using UPM may want to write proprietary programs with your sensors so please avoid GPL. If your license is not MIT, please include a LICENSE file in src/mymodule/.<br/>
					• The top of each source file must contain a comment block containing the license information. Please test your module builds before contributing and make sure it works on the latest version of libmraa. If you tested on a specific board/platform please tell us what this was in your PR.<br/>
					• Try not to break the master in any commit.<br/>
					• Include API documentation as described in the the @ref documentation guide.<br/>
